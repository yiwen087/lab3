![David's graph of religious participation vs age](DavidF-plot.svg)

This plot shows how participation in religious and spiritual activity in the USA is different at different ages.  The graph is based on data from the 2017 American Time Use Survey, in which
respondents recorded how they spent all of their time on the day before they were interviewed.
The above graph shows the percentage of respondents, at different ages, who reported that they had spent any time at all on religious and spiritual activity on the day in question.

The graph shows how such participation increases from less than 10% of 20-year-olds, to 20% or more of the oldest survey respondents.  It should be noted that the data for the very oldest respondents --- those aged 80 and over --- is less reliable than at other ages, partly because of small numbers and partly because of the rounded recording of older ages in the published ATUS data.
    
**The above is just an illustrative example of the sort of graph and text you might include in this file.  I fully expect that some of the graphs you'll produce will be more interesting than this one!**

![Alexander's graph: sports, exercise and recreation vs. age](Alexander-plot.svg)

The plot displayed above shows how the amount of time people spend on sports, exercise and recreation varies with age, as well as the influences that gender has on this relationship. The data used to generate the plot is from the American Time Use Survey compiled by the [Bureau of Labour Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/tus/), and can be downloaded [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavidFirth/lab3/master/atussum_2017.csv). The survey measures the amount of time people spend performing various activities, such as paid work, childcare, volunteering, and socialising.

The plot shows that the time spent on sports, exercise and recreation peaks between the ages of 15 and 25 and decays as people get older. This could likely be due to the fact that people normally have more free time when they are young. When we look at the curves for male and female respondents separately, we see that men are more active than women when they are young, but then women are more active than men between the ages of 75 and 85. In fact, women at the age of 85 spend about 160% more time on sports, exercise and recreation than men of the same age. However, it should be noted that 571 respondents of the total of 10,223 are between the ages of 80 and 85, which represents a proportion of 5.4%, compared to the most abundant age group being the one between 35 and 40 representing a proportion of 9.8% of the total. The difference, although large, should not alone be a reason to discard our previous conclusion, since 5.4% is only slightly below 6.67%, which is the proportion of respondents each category would have if they were assigned randomly (for categories of 5 years).

It is worth noting that the data for ages above 80 is aggregated to be either 80 or 85, most likely due to the fact that less people in that age range participated in the survey. Despite this, we do not expect that this will impact on our results, as we don't require the resolution of the age data to be 1 year.

This plot shows that the percentage of individuals who participated in sports, exercise and recreation at different age and gender,using data from the USA, based on data from the 2017 American Time Use Survey(compile by the Bureau of Labour Statistics), in which respondents recorded how they spent all of their time on the day before they were interviewed.This Survey provides the structure of time alloction for people in different age and gender performing in various activities such as Socialising, Volunteering , Travelling and Childcare.

The above graph shows the percentage of respondents, at different ages and gender, who reported that they had spent any time at all on sports, exercise, and recreation the day in question.

When we ignore the gender influence,for the general trend,the graph is fluctuating after the initial plunge, which started from over 35% of participants aged 15 to less than 20% of participants aged 23 to 30. This may be due to the fact that we have more energy and spare time when we were young. It then fluctuated around 20 percentage with age, with the bottom point occurring around 25, late 50, and the oldest survey participants. The relative peak appeared in participants aged about 35 and nearly 68. In conclusion, younger people engage more in sports, exercise and recreation, especially for those aged 15 to 20 teenagers.

Consider the gender influence,we can observe from two different curves that men are generally more actively engaging in sports, exercise and recreation than women except over 80. It should be noted that 571 respondents aged either 80 or 85 are recorded in the total of 10233 respondents, which occupys nearly 5% in total, therefore it is also a dominant part and should be considered into conclusion. There is enough evidence to show that 85-year-old women spend nearly twice as much time on sports, exercise and recreation as 85-year-old men.

It also should be noted that the data for the very oldest respondents,the data for ages above 80 is only recorded participants aged 85 and this graph is lack of the age data between 81 and 84. Therefore, it is less reliable than at other ages, partly because of small numbers and partly because of the rounded recording of older ages in the published ATUS data. But, this doesn't affect the conclusion made above.

The above graphic shows us the percentage of individuals who participated in any 'Work Related Activity', using data from the USA, based on 2017 American Time Use Survey, in which respondents recorded how they spent all of the time on the day before they were interviewed. The percentage refers to the percentage of participants who spent **any time at all** on work related activities on the dayin question.  Further, the graphic demonstrates how this varies with the sex of the individuals.  

From the graph, we can see that men are more likely to participate in 'work related activities' than woman at all ages - as the green (male) curve, exceeds that of the red (female) curve for all ages. For the entire collection of participants, work based activities are seen to increase from 20% to 40% from the ages of 20 to 25. It can also be seen that participating in 'work based activities' reaches a peak between 40 and 50 years of age; though the peak is slightly later for female individuals, and slightly earlier for male individuals.

![Daniel's graph of the effect of spending time looking after family members on the relationship between age and time spent on work-related activities, for both men and women](DanielT-plot.svg)
    
The plot shows how participation % in **work-related activities** varies with age in the USA. The graph is build using [data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavidFirth/lab3/master/atussum_2017.csv) from the 2017 American Time Use Survey (ATUS). The ATUS dataset for 2017 records the amount of time spent by people, in one specific day, in each of 17 categories of activity. This [link](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DavidFirth/lab3/blob/master/ATUS%20top-level%20time%20use%20categories.html) provides a short description of the 17 categories. 

The graph splits the data dependent on sex and whether the participant had spent *any time at all* on looking after family members. We can see that for the majority of ages, a higher proportion of men spend *any time at all* on work-related activities than women. This is arguably not a big surprise as the US, like most of the world, has a history of men being the household earners. Therefore the more interesting information from this graph is for women, in the 20-48 age range, it appears that part of the reasoning for low participation is because they are spending time looking after family members. For men we cannot make this conclusion as it very much depends on age. 

It should be noted that participants aged 81-84 and 85+ had their ages rounded to 80 and 85 respectively. However, this does not affect any conlusions made above.

   ![Danius' graph showing the relationship between age and time spent on education](DaniusBackisplotfinal.svg)

The graph above depicts the relationship between the average time spent on educational activities and the age of the respondents. As one would expect, the younger the respondent, the more they spend time educating themselves. The maximum is attained at 17 years old, when people spend on average 200 minutes per day on education, and then it drops quickly. 7 years later, less than 24 minutes per day are spent on education. It can also be noted that from 50 years old participants practically never spend time on education, which I found quite surprising. 

    
### DAVID

![David's graph of sleep vs age and sex](DavidH-plot.svg)

The above graph shows how age and sex differences impact the participants' sleep, with data taken from the [American Time Use Survey.](https://www.bls.gov/tus/). Firstly, we can see that young people, teenagers in particular, slept for longer than any other age group. This is perhaps explained by not spending as much time working, as this age group also spends less time working than any other. The elderly also spend less time working, and more time sleeping, than most other age groups. However, they sleep less than young people, which can be explained by physical differences causing a need for less sleep. In fact, there is significant evidence of a negative correlation between work and sleep, with Pearson correlation coefficient r = -0.32.

Among those with ages 20-60, we see fluctuations in the data. Women in their 40s and 50s sleep less than women at any other point in their lives. A possible explanation for this is motherhood, although we would expect to see a dip earlier in their lives. Men also see a slight increase in sleep during this time. Overall, women sleep more than men, except for those that are very young and old.

It should be noted that the values in this chart seem very large, as the average time spent sleeping for all participants in 8 hours and 36 minutes, and the average for those under 20 is almost 10 hours. A Gallup [poll](https://news.gallup.com/poll/166553/less-recommended-amount-sleep.aspx) found that the average time a US person spends sleeping is 6.8 hours. I only used the category t010101: Sleeping for my graph, so any variation between these is due to the methodology of the studies.
    
### DENIS

The plot shows the how the amount of time spent on housework changes as people age, divided by the gender of the survey respondents. The graph shows that, generally speaking, as one gets older, one tends to spend more time on housework - until one reaches their 70s, when the amount of time spent on housework reduces. Arguably, this should not come as much of a surprise - the older you are, the larger your house is likely to be, and the more time you will need to spend on housework. Furthermore, the elderly tend to be quite frail, and they simply may not be physically capable of spending the same amount of time as they used to spend on housework.

Most notably, we observe that at all ages, women spend more time on housework than men - which, depending on your point of view, may or may not come as a surprise. 

It is also worth noting that there is limited data on participants under the age of 18, and on participants over the age of 80.

Interestingly, when the variables are plotted using a similar methodology to the one followed by David, the two variables begin to insinuate a potentially more complex relationship. The graph depicts smoothed curves of the percentage of people at each age value who participate in each activity for at least some amount of time.

The curve for volunteering related activities has notable increases around the ages of 20 and below, as well as beyond 60-65 which is a fairly standard retirement age. This could be attributed to young people, namely students and people yet to start working full time, having more time to volunteer. Similarly, older people who have retired will also have more time to volunteer.

The percentage of people volunteering falls from around 7% to a low point of almost 3% in mid to late 20 year olds which could signify a significant loss of free time as people start families and careers at this age. It is also interesting to observe a bump in the mid-40's (also observable in time spent working, perhaps as people reach the middle of their life and feel pressured to contribute to something external, be it work or volunteering) followed by an even larger bump at ages beyond 65 where a height of around 10% of people volunteering is reached among assumed retirees.

The general pattern of the data is clear in that the majority of time spent is on working between the ages of 20's to 60's, as would be expected intuitively. It is unfortunate that the numbers of people volunteering and time spent volunteering is significantly lower than that of people working. Though the way in which people split their time does indeed suggest a conclusion of a weak relationship between people who work less having a higher probability of spending at least *some* time volunteering.

![James's graph of household care vs age and gender](James-plot.svg)

The above figure conveys an inequality in both gender and age of individuals caring for members within the American home. Participants of the 2017 American Time Use Survey (ATUS) were expected to note how many hours of the day before their interview they had spent on various tasks. In the graph, we may see the proportion of the total reported hours directed to this care, split by age and sex.

Of all reported hours caring for others within their home, across almost all ages, females (grey) report a higher number of hours than males (pink). Secondly, younger woman (25-35) spend considerably more time on this task than men of the same age range. Interestingly, men do show a clear peak in their late thirties, perhaps correlated to their aging parents seeking their help. The trend lines are provided solely for illustrative purposes of indicating the distinct differences in proportions, as they have not been statistically scrutinized. Similarly, the tails of these rough distributions, and hence these data, should be considered somewhat unreliable due to small sample size within these age ranges.

![Jia Le's graph of spending time consumer purchases against age, per month](JiaLian-plot.svg)

This plot illustrates the proportion of males and females who spent time on making consumer purchases by age, on a monthly basis. The data is taken from the 2017 American Time Use Survey, which recorded the time spent by individuals on the day before their interview. 

In general, the proportion of individual who spent time purchasing consumer goods increases with age, peaking at around 40 years old. This is followed by a downward slope as we move towards the 60-80 age range. This could be explained by elder people having restricted mobility compared to younger people, thus many of them no longer spent time on consumer purchases. 

It is also evident that, there is a larger proportion of female who spent time on making consumer purchases than male as the red lines are mostly above the blue lines. Besides, it is interesting to observe that there is a largest difference in proportion of men and women, aged between 20 and 40, who spent time on consumer purchases in February and April whereas, there is least difference in the proportion in May and December. 

It should be noted that there are more females who spent time on consumer purchases and data from those aged over 80 is less reliable because of rounding and there are only a small number of them.

This plot shows how participation in volunteer activities in the USA is different at different ages.  The graph is based on data from the 2017 American Time Use Survey, in which respondents recorded how they spent all of their time on the day before they were interviewed.
    
The above graph shows the percentage of respondents, at different ages and genders, who reported that they had spent any time at all on religious and spiritual activity on the day in question.

The graph shows that for female respondents, the proportion of time spent on volunteer activities remains in the same level at around 13% except for the age 30s, where illustrates a small, drop, decreasing to 8%. Similarly, the data of male participants also witness a drop in their 30s, from 9% to 5%. However, different from the data of female participants, there is a significant peak of the percentage of time spent by male respondents on volunteer activities, rising sharply to 17% and then drop to 4%.
    
In conclusion, for most of the ages, female participants spend more time on volunteer activities than male participant except for the men st the age of 72.

   The graph above represents how the change of age and the frequency of usage of professional caring are correlated. The data used in this graph was extracted from the 2017 American Time Use Survey. The participants of this study were asked to take a record of the length of hours that they have been taken care by professional care services. Not only that, but also the age of participants varies from teenagers to 80s.

  To explain the plot more explicitly, the green line represents men hiring professional caring, the red line represents women hiring care, and the violet line in the middle shows the average frequency of using caring service. One thing in common between men and women is that the older they are, the more likely for them to hire professional caring service for themselves. However, it is easy to notice that the rate of change of the graph between men and women differ. To be concise, according to the graph, as women get older, it is less likely for them to have professional health care. On the other hand, the age of men and the need of health care is proportional. As a result, the average percentage of professional health care is nearly proportional to age.

![Nathan's graph of time spent on socialising, relaxing and leisure vs age](NathanM-plot.svg)

This graph shows how the amount of time spent on socialising, relaxing and leisure (SR&L) in the USA differs depending on whether a person undertakes volunteer activities. The data used to produce this graphic is from the 2017 _American Time Use Survey_, in which respondents were asked to record which activities they had undertaken the previous day, and for how long. 

\
From the graph, regardless of gender, respondents who spent any amount of time volunteering on a given day spent noticeably less time on SR&L than those not volunteering.

\
Looking at males, the amount of time spent by volunteers on SR&L, on a given day, follows a very similar trend to that of non-volunteers. In fact, it appears the trend for time spent on SR&L by volunteers is, for the most part, a scaled down version of the trend for non-volunteers. The only noticeable difference is for males over 70. 
\
For males over 70 the amount of time spent by volunteers on SR&L deviates from the trend observed in non-volunteers; as age increases there is a decrease in the amount of time spent by volunteering males on SR&L. A possible explanation is the wide 95% confidence interval for volunteers over 70, which suggests that only a small proportion of respondents were males over the age of 70 who engaged in volunteering on a given day.

\
Looking at females, there is no overlap of the 95% confidence intervals for time spent on SR&L by volunteers and non-volunteers. This means we can confidently conclude that, across all ages, there is a statistically significant difference between the time spent on SR&L, on a given day, by volunteers and non-volunteers (Note that this does not infer that since male volunteers and non-volunteers overlap there isn't a statistically significant difference).
\
The trend for female volunteers does not match that of the female non-volunteers as closely as the trends for males does. This is particularly true for females under the age of 30. The 95% confidence interval for volunteering females under 30 is much wider than that of non-volunteers. This suggests that, out of all female respondents, relatively few of them under the age of 30 were engaged in volunteering on a given day.


    
### NEEL

![Neel's graph of volunteering activity by sex vs age](NeelSachania-plot.svg)

This plot shows how participation in volunteering activities in the USA varies for different ages. The graph is produced using data from the 2017 American Time Use Survey (ATUS), in which data has been collected to better understand how time is divided across different activities. The above graph shows the percentage of respondents, of different ages, separated by sex who had spent any time at all on volunteering activites. These include a range of activities such as performance, cultural, administrative, care and maintenance activities.   

The graph shows, that the participation percentage for each sex spending any time on volunteering activities follows a similar trend up until the age of 60. From this age, the percentage of male participation in volunteering activities increases significantly, which may correspond to the age of retirement. The peak participation occurs at approximately 73 years of age for both males and females, where roughly 10% of both sexes participate in volunteering activities. It must be noted that the ages of respondents greater than or equal to 80 have been rounded to the ages of 80 or 85, making it less reliable for drawing conclusions.

![](NirajSplot.svg)

This plot investigates how time spent looking after their household members in the USA varies by age. The red plot shows this relationship for females, and the blue plot shows this relationship for males.

The plot shows that the relationship between time spent looking after household members and age is similar for both males and females. This is, that the amount of time looking after household members increases as age increases to a certain point, and then the time spent looking after household members decreases. We can also clearly interpret from the plot that from ages 15 to 50, females generally spend more time looking after household members than males. However, once ages get to 50 or order, the time spent looking after household members is effectively the same for both females and males. It should not come as a surprise that females spend more time daily in looking after household members than males. The plot also confirms what we should expect when people get older and closer to retirement, as their body is more frail and hence they are unlikely to spend as much time looking after their household members.
    
### REECE

    09 10 12
    
![Reece's graph of extensive social activity vs age](ReeceM-plot.svg)

The plot shows how likely different ages of both males and females are to spend more than eight hours per day on socialising, relaxing and leisure per day. The bands around each line show a 95% confidence interval for each of the fits. Time spent on each activity was recorded as part of the 2017 American Time Use Survey.

From the graph, we can see a global trend of people being less likely to spend a quarter of their day socialising around the ages of 30-60; this is perhaps due to most people in this age bracket being employed. The most surprising conclusion to draw is that people over the age of 70 are more likely than not to spend at least 6 hours socialising (as the percentage for males and females exceeds 50%), and in fact by the age of 85, the graph suggests there is a 70% chance. This may be due to a smaller sample size, or rounding in the data, but the result does not seem to be anomalous. It is also interesting how sex does not appear to offer any new trends in the data: the overall trend for both curves is very similar, however that for men is consistently higher, especially for younger ages.
    
### RICHARD

![Richard's Graph of Socializing, Relaxing and Leisure vs Age](RichardM-plot.svg)

The graph depicts the relationship between the age of the survey participant and the average time spent on relaxing, socializing and leisure, which is divided into male and female.
The graph shows a contrasting relationship between men and women before the age of 20. However, the standard errors are larger for ages below 20, so these average values may not be correct. Furthermore, the sample for these ages may have been taken from people who are in work, and not students, who would have a higher average time for socializing especially. The graph's minimum points are at age 32 for women and 37 for men. One can deduce that these ages for men and women spent the least amount of time on socializing, relaxing and leisure because this could be the age when people decide to start a family, as well as be the busiest with work, with both of these reducing the amount of time a person can spend socializing, relaxing and time on leisure. There is an upward global trend after this, perhaps suggesting that the children of some participants are older and require less time to tend to.

We can observe that men seem to spend more time on these activities than women on average, for the majority of the ages, which has many interpretations, although we cannot draw conclusions.
    
### SAMUEL

The plot shows the proportion of time people spend on sports and recreation as opposed to education. Note that only people included in this plot are those who _are_ in education. All respondents were specified to have an age under 25, so the graph isn't clouded by the many ages that are not in education. 
The graph shows that males between the 15-17 age bracket spend far more on recreational activites, since the values for these ages fall above the 0.5 line. As the age increases, the proportions through the ages fall together; reason for this could include and increase in difficulty relating to higher eduation.
For females however, the proportion does not change much over time, perhaps due to female students being more motivated in school.

The above graph is based on the data drawn from 2017 American Time Use Survey. It compares the time spent of individual on household activities per day between females and males for the age ranges from around 15 to 85. First of all, the gap between two lines shows that in general, women do more housework than men at each range of age. Besides, the sexual difference is relatively narrow for people who are under 25, since most people are still students at that age range (15-25). With the growth of age, people tend to spend more time on housework. There is a decreasing trend from 70, which might be due to some physical reasons. Lastly, since majority participants are from 20 to 60, more data will be needed to get the conclusion of people who are under 20 and over 70.
